 <title>Documenting ducks</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>In the previous chapter, you learned about ownership and care of domestic ducks. In this
   chapter, you’ll learn how to document valuable information about your ducks using the Magic
   Mallard duck database.</p>
  <p>Every duck owner should keep track of her ducks’ growth. With the Magic Mallard database, you
   can create an entry for each duck. Each entry contains a chart where you can type in the duck’s
   height, weight, and wingspan week by week.</p>
  <p>To add an entry for a duck to your database, type <codeph>add entry</codeph> followed by the
   name of the duck in parentheses into the command line and press Enter.</p>
