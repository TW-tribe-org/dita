                     <div class="p">Q: We are using XMetaL Author Edition version 5.1.1. with our own
                        			 DITA set up. This topic is set as &quot;task&quot; and includes sets of unordered steps
                        			 with substeps. (However, the same thing happens in numbered steps without
                        			 substeps.) I am having a real problem inserting a Note following a step. When
                        			 the cursor is placed following step 7 (or anywhere in the previous six steps)
                        			 and then select menu Insert &gt; Paragraph &gt; Note, the Note is inserted
                        			 following step 10! It does not seem to matter where the cursor is, all the
                        			 notes go in the same spot, one after the other. Is this a bug? Or is something
                        			 else wrong? The same thing happens in tag view as well, no matter where I put
                        			 the cursor. 
                        		  </div> 
                     		  
                     <div class="p">A: The note is getting tossed down to the bottom of your list of
                        			 steps because that is the closest location to the cursor where the note element
                        			 is allowed by the DITA Task DTD. Notes aren't allowed directly as a child
                        			 element of step or cmd, and since the element you're trying to insert using the
                        			 menu isn't allowed in that location, XmetaL is doing its best by putting nit in
                        			 the closest legal location it can find. If you want to insert a note in a task
                        			 step, you can insert an &lt;info&gt; element, then insert a note element. Info
                        			 is just a container in this case, and can be inserted after the &lt;cmd&gt;
                        			 element in a step. The &lt;info&gt; element doesn't have any implications for
                        			 output formatting - the note will appear as it would in any other context.

                        			 allowed where by the DTD is to use the Element List window in XmetaL. You can
                        			 find it under the View menu. Unlike drop-down menus, the Element List will only
                        			 show elements that are allowed by the DTD at the cursor's current position. To
                        			 insert an element, you can select the element and click [Apply], or just
                        			 double-click it. Our writers use it religiously.
