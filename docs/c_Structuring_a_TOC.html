               		<dfn class="term">generations</dfn> of topic families. 
               	 </div>
            <div class="p">A three level hierarchy with seven topics per menu will permit 343
               		pages. Four layers of ten topics permits up to 10,000 topics, which is more

            <div class="p">The human mind thinks in associative, rather than linear, patterns. Thus

               		<q class="q">forget how we got onto this subject</q>. The human brain stores
               		information in this way also, by finding a similar experience and associating
               		it with the current experience (<q class="q">this tastes like vinegar</q>).

            <div class="p">In DITA, concept information is separated from task and reference
               		information. This makes it more difficult to structure a document purely around
               		the goals of the reader, unless the nature of the information allows the
               		creation of standard sets of one concept, one task and one reference topic.
               		Such an information model would permit a TOC structure such as:

                        			 Reference) at the top level, as opposed to organizing topics around user goals
                        			 (e.g., Setting Up Projects, Copying Files, etc), which was the documentation
                        			 standard before the advent of structured authoring. Organizing TOCs around
                        			 information types separates concepts from related tasks and reference topics.
                        			 This seems to be a major usability problem. Users don't open up help systems

                        			 &quot;How do I ...?&quot; or &quot;What's ...?&quot;. If that's my question then structuring by
                        			 infotype first isn't such a bad idea. But you're right, different people think
                        			 differently about how to structure a help set. I did an experiment with the
                        			 authors in my team, getting everyone to structure our product's help the
                        			 &quot;right&quot; way, and there were as many structures as authors. We came to the
                        			 conclusion that the ideas of infotype, product feature, workflow process, etc.,
                        			 were largely orthogonal to each other, and that a single-hierarchy organization
                        			 would never satisfy every user. How that translated to our documentation is
                        			 that we realized the importance of each topic having a good set of related
                        			 topic links. Of course, this is exactly what DITA reltables are for. So I don't
                        			 know that there is &quot;a&quot; best practice as such. Each help set may have its own
                        			 best view, and some help sets might benefit from multiple views
                        			 (user-selectable ToCs, there's a thought). Given how the emphasis seems to be
                        			 on using &quot;search&quot; features now for online help, perhaps the structure of a ToC
                        			 doesn't matter that much.
