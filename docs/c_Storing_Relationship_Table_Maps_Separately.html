                     <div class="p">We have some DITA help systems that are 1000+ topics. The only way
                        			 to effectively manage related links is through reltables. In larger help
                        			 systems, we use one top level DITA map with sub-maps that correspond to
                        			 top-level folders in the help system TOC. Since related links are typically to
                        			 topics within the same folder, we partition the reltables into each submap to
                        			 make them easier to manage (it's possible to include related links to topics in
                        			 other folders, too).

                        			 the associated map for reltable entries pertaining to those topics, to see if
                        			 they are still valid. If they had to check other topics for possible related
                        			 links, it would be very difficult... we'd have to maintain a separate
                        			 spreadsheet with a mapping of all topic relations, and why do that when you
                        			 have reltables?

                  <div> You might want to consider
                     		  multiple reltables. Take a better look at your relationships and look for
                     		  patterns that might make this simpler. Also, you could have reltables in
                     		  submaps thus making the management a little more &quot;manageable&quot; by component.
